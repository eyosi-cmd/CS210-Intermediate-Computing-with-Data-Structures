1. Hours to complete the project: 12 hours

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Model a Percolation System): This problem was very tricky and challenging at first. After attending the SI section and having an explanation from the instructor, I got some understanding of the project. Following that, I created an instance of private datatypes and object. One of the hardest parts arranging the lists in the model which is to make sure the system percolate, and I did not know what encode imply for so i asked the TA, I got a better explanation for that. In general, The code was straight forward because all the method were given with a detail description in the project checklist file.
 
    Problem 2 (Estimate Percolation Threshold): Once I solved the percolation problem, working on the stats was not that hard. I just made some arrangements in this problem utilizing the previous program. Most importantly, the instruction was clear to follow. 

3. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.
